# Two Tubs - MIS 426

This is an assignment for my MIS 426 course, a course taught at Oakland University.
We covered how to use GameMaker Studio in this course.

## Installation

Run the game in GameMaker 1.4. 

## How to play the game

The yellow character can only get the yellow objects, the green character can only get the green object.
You will lose if: The character collide with each other, or if you miss a total of 6 (or more) objects.
